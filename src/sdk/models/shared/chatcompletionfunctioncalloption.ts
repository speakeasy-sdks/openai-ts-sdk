 * Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function.  Specifying a particular function via `{"name":\ "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present.
